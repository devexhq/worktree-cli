# wt-review

Review a change set in `worktree-cli` on five axes:

1. **Plan fidelity**: does the code implement `.agentic/plan.md`'s contracts, no more and no less.
2. **Implementation and invariant compliance**: does the code hold up (correctness, layering, typing, tests, performance, DB hygiene).
3. **Doc adherence**: does it obey every directive in `AGENTS.md` and `docs/agents/*.md`, and does it update the docs this change was required to update.
4. **Redundancy and subtraction**: does anything here duplicate a contract already pinned, or survive with no consumer.
5. **Enforcement integrity**: can every check this change adds or relies on actually fail.

Output goes to `.agentic/review.md`, which `/wt-code review` consumes, paired with `.agentic/review.json`.

## Hard boundaries

- **Never run tests or tooling.** No `inv test`, no `pytest`, no `ruff`, no `basedpyright`, no `inv complexity`. `/wt-code` owns the gate; a review that leans on tool output stops reading the code. Read-only `git`, read-only `gh`, `rg`, and file reads are what you need.
- **Never edit, stage, commit, or push.** Report findings and hand off. `/wt-code review` applies the fixes.
- **Never approve on absence of evidence.** A rule you did not check is not a rule that passed.
- **Never treat a passing suite as a verified invariant.** The checks most likely to be broken are the ones reporting success, because a scanner that inspects nothing is indistinguishable from a clean tree.
- **Re-read from disk.** Every file you reason about is read fresh in this session, never recalled from earlier context.

## 1. Resolve the diff scope

| Input | Scope | Inspect with |
|---|---|---|
| PR number given | that PR's range | `gh pr view <n> --json baseRefName,headRefName,title,body`, then `git fetch origin` and `git diff origin/<base>...origin/<head>` |
| Working tree dirty | uncommitted work | `git status --porcelain`, `git diff`, `git diff --staged`, plus full contents of untracked files in scope |
| Clean tree | commits on this branch | `git diff origin/<default>...HEAD` (resolve the default with `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef`) |

Record the changed-file list and the diff size (`git diff --stat`). If the scope is empty, say so and stop.

## 2. Delegate for independence

In a single-agent setup, the author and reviewer share one context, so the review inherits the author's assumptions and blind spots. **A same-session review is a weak control and must declare itself**: if this session planned or wrote the code, set `provenance` to `same_session` in the eventual report, re-derive every finding from the diff and the docs, and discard in-session claims that something was already verified or intentional. The quoted-evidence requirement in section 5 exists precisely for this case: in same-session mode, treat any clause you cannot support with a quoted line as `FAIL`, not `PASS`.

**If this session wrote any of the code under review, delegate the audit to a fresh subagent** instead of reviewing it yourself. Give it a strong reasoning model, preferably a different family than the one that wrote the code. A spawned subagent has no read-only switch of its own, so restate the Hard boundaries above verbatim in its instructions and make them the first thing it reads. Hand it the resolved scope from section 1, the standards to load in section 3, and nothing else: no rationale, no "I already verified X". Let it read the standards and run the sweep itself, and have it set `provenance` to `fresh_session` in its report.

If a subagent cannot be launched, say so and do not self-approve. Fail closed unless the user explicitly overrides.

When this review is already running in a fresh session with no author bias to correct for, run it inline — there is no one to delegate to.

## 3. Load the standards yourself

Do not review from memory of this repo. Read [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) — the authority and the doc index for what governs what — the docs it names for the areas the diff touches, the domain-scoped `RULES.md` files, and [REVIEW_CHECKLIST.json](../../../docs/agents/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.json). Read `.agentic/plan.md` if it exists, as the change's contract.

When a doc's claim about a model, field list, or enum drives a finding, spot-check the source first. Source wins. **A stale doc is a finding, not a condition to route around**: a "enforced by" claim naming a file that doesn't exist, a documented helper that was never written, or a rule example that teaches the violation it forbids. Resolve every such claim that bears on this change (`rg --files -g '<name>'`) rather than working around a wrong sentence and leaving it for the next agent to trust.

## 4. Check plan fidelity

Skip this axis only when `.agentic/plan.md` is absent, and say so in the report.

- Every FR has landed, and every artifact row has its file.
- Contracts match exactly: field names, types, defaults, `status` values, flag names, help copy, exit codes, and error, warning, and fix strings. A "better" name than the plan's is a finding, since the plan was human-reviewed.
- Nothing landed that the plan marked out of scope or named as a trap.
- **Test ledger fidelity, row by row.** Each planned test exists at the planned path, asserting the stated contract. Then check the other direction: every test file in the diff appears in the ledger. An unplanned test file is a scope breach that no gate catches.
- **Deletion ledger fidelity.** Every entry is gone.
- **Budget.** Compare the diff size against the plan's estimate.
- Where the code deviates, the deviation was surfaced rather than absorbed silently.

## 5. Sweep the mechanical rules and invariant checklist

The rules that get missed are the ones no linter enforces, and they are missed because reviewers read for design and skim identifiers. Do this as an explicit pass, not a byproduct.

1. **Match rule scope.** For each changed path, filter [REVIEW_CHECKLIST.json](../../../docs/agents/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.json) for rules whose `scope` encompasses it (`src/worktree/core/` matches `ARCH-*`, formatters match `RENDER-*`, `**/models.py` matches `MODEL-*`, `tests/` matches `TEST-*`, and `domain: all` match everything).
2. **Audit item by item** against each rule's evaluation_criteria, line by line, and record PASS, FAIL, or N/A .
3. **Audit each clause line by line** against the rule's `evaluation_criteria`.
4. **Classify severity:**
    - `BLOCKER` (architectural drift, concurrency risk, boundary leaks, runtime crashes, `assert` in `src/`, assertions on human-rendered output, an enforcement check that cannot fail, a breached plan contract, a missing required doc update),
    - `WARNING` (high-impact convention or type degradation),
    - `SUGGESTION` (constructive improvement not required now),
    - `NIT` (cosmetic, no rule behind it).

Every naming, model, placement, typing, and test convention a reviewer must check by eye — because no linter here enforces it — is a rule in `REVIEW_CHECKLIST.json`: step 1 of this pass is what puts them in scope, there is no separate checklist to consult.

Each finding names the rule ID and the doc it comes from. If you cannot cite a rule, it is a Suggestion or a Nit, not Blocking.

## 6. Check doc adherence

Work through [doc-adherence.md](doc-adherence.md) with the changed-file list. It maps each kind of change to the directive it must satisfy and the doc that must have been updated in the same change.

A missing required doc update is Blocking. A doc update that was not required is a Suggestion to delete it. A doc paragraph describing behavior this change did not build is Blocking too.

When this change edits `docs/agents/rules_spec.yaml`, confirm the compiled artifacts were regenerated and committed in the same change (`uv run python scripts/compile_rules.py`), since the pre-commit parity hook fails on drift.

## 7. Judge what you cannot run

You are not running the gates, so reason about them from the diff and mark each as a risk rather than a result:

- Functions whose nesting or `elif` chains look likely to exceed cognitive complexity 10.
- Suppressions and `Any` annotations that would let `basedpyright --level error` pass while hiding a real error.
- Branches with no covering test, especially in a factory or dispatch chain.

Say `not run by this skill` for anything you are inferring, and keep it distinct from `not enforced by this repo`, which is a finding from section 7. Never report an inference as a gate result.

## 8. Write the report

Write this to `.agentic/review.md` (create `.agentic/` if needed), overwriting the previous round, and echo the verdict plus the Blocking list in chat:

```markdown
## wt-review - round <n>

**Verdict:** APPROVE | CHANGES REQUIRED
**Scope:** <PR #n | uncommitted | origin/<default>...HEAD> (<k> files, <+a/-d> lines)
**Plan:** `.agentic/plan.md` <sha or "absent">
**Provenance:** fresh session | same session that wrote the code

### Blocking
- `path:line`
  - Rule: `ARCH-001` (Strict Layered Import Flow)
  - Issue: what is wrong and the rule it breaks (`<package>/docs/RULES.md#ARCH-001` or `<doc>#<section>`).
  - Fix: the concrete fix.

### Warnings
- `path:line` — same shape as Blocking.

### Suggestions
- `path:line` — Issue / Fix, no rule ID required.

### Nits
- `path:line` — minor style or wording observation.


| Rule ID | Clause | Severity | Status | Evidence (quoted) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TEST-007` | assert relevant domain invariants | SUGGESTION | FAIL | `tests/cli/sandbox/test_diff.py:88` mechanically asserts empty default envelope fields instead of targeted domain invariants |
| `TEST-011` | no wall-clock sleeps | BLOCKER | FAIL | `tests/core/step/test_process_group.py:58` reads `time.sleep(0.05)` |

### Plan fidelity
- <FR-n> - implemented as specified | deviates: <what> | missing
- Test ledger: <k> planned rows landed at path and marker | <deviations>
- Unplanned test files: <paths or "none">
- Deletion ledger: executed | <outstanding>
- Budget: planned <n> lines, actual <m>

### Redundancy
- <path> - duplicates <path> (<contract>); recommend delete | none

### Enforcement integrity
- <check> - can fail (negative fixture at <path:line>) | vacuous: <why> | scope narrower than claim
- Unenforced gates relied on by this change: <gate and where the gap is, or "none">

### Doc adherence
- <gate tripped> - satisfied | missing update to <doc> | not applicable
- Unresolved enforcement claims: <doc:line naming a nonexistent file, or "none">

### Unverified
- Gates were not run by this skill. Risks read from the diff: <complexity, coverage, typing risks, or "none">

### Residual (rounds exhausted only)
- <finding> - unresolved after round 3, handed to the human
```

Say `APPROVE` only with zero Blocking items. An empty section stays, marked `none`. Each item is `path:line` (or `path` file-level) followed by `Rule`, `Issue`, `Fix`.

With `--post` and a PR scope, post the same content as a comment review: `gh pr review <n> --comment --body-file .agentic/review.md`. Never `--approve` or `--request-changes`, and do not add reviewers.

On `CHANGES REQUIRED`, hand off to `/wt-code review`, then re-run this skill as round n+1 against the updated scope. **Cap at 3 rounds.** At the cap, every unresolved finding goes in the `Residual` section, in `review.json` under `residual`, and, when the scope is a PR, into a posted comment.

## 11. Emit the machine-readable verdict

Write `.agentic/review.json` alongside the markdown and print the same object as the last line of stdout, minified onto one line. A caller decides the next step from this file alone.

```json
{
  "verdict": "CHANGES_REQUIRED",
  "round": 1,
  "provenance": "same_session",
  "scope": { "kind": "pr", "ref": "364", "files": 7 },
  "plan": ".agentic/plan.md",
  "counts": { "blocking": 2, "warnings": 1, "suggestions": 3, "nits": 1 },
  "findings": [
    { "severity": "BLOCKER", "path": "src/worktree/core/diff/services/render.py", "line": 42, "rule": "ARCH-001", "summary": "Core service imports CliContext directly." }
  ],
  "unenforced_gates": ["coverage fail_under=0 in pyproject.toml"],
  "residual": []
}
```

Field contracts, since this is what a loop branches on:

- `verdict` is exactly `APPROVE` or `CHANGES_REQUIRED` (underscored, so it survives shell and condition matching), and is `APPROVE` iff `counts.blocking` is `0`.
- `provenance` is `fresh_session` or `same_session`. `scope.kind` is `pr`, `uncommitted`, or `branch`.
- `plan` is the plan path, or `null` when absent.
- `findings` carries every Blocking and Warning item with line-level detail; `counts` always reflects the full report.
- `unenforced_gates` and `residual` stay `[]` when there are none.

Changes to this shape are additive only. It is the contract a driver script consumes today, and the `outputs` condition a `wt` blueprint will branch on later, so a renamed field breaks both.
