# CI and Tooling

Guidelines and requirements for local quality gates and continuous integration.

---

## Lint and Format

**Relevant sources:** `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.ruff]`)

- Config lives in `pyproject.toml` (Python 3.13, line length 120; rule sets `E, W, F, I, B, C4, UP, RUF, FA, D` with Google docstrings).
- Commands:
  ```bash
  ruff check .              # lint check
  ruff check --fix .        # apply safe fixes
  ruff format --check .     # format check
  ruff format .             # apply formatting
  ```

---

## Type Checking

**Relevant sources:** `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.basedpyright]`)

- Config lives in `pyproject.toml` (`typeCheckingMode = "recommended"`, package `src/worktree/`).
- Commands:
  ```bash
  basedpyright src                # typecheck
  basedpyright src --level error   # error gate (must be 0 errors)
  ```
- **Suppression comments:** Must use `# pyright: ignore[reportRuleName]` with a
  reason. Bare `# type: ignore` is not honored. Which rules may be suppressed
  is in [code-conventions.md](code-conventions.md#type-checker-suppressions).

## Complexity Gate

**Relevant sources:** `pyproject.toml`, `tasks.py`

- Gated via `complexipy` with threshold **max cognitive complexity <= 10**.
- Commands:
  ```bash
  inv complexity                                          # whole tree
  inv complexity --paths src/worktree/cli/run/app.py       # scoped to specific paths
  inv complexity --plain                                  # plain output for scripts/agents
  inv complexity --plain --failed                         # report failures only
  inv complexity --local                                  # check staged files
  ```
- Agents must verify that touched files pass the complexity gate before committing.

---

## Continuous Integration (CI)

**Relevant sources:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Four CI jobs run on pushes to `main` and on pull requests:
- **test**: `uv sync --all-extras` and `pytest -n auto` with coverage (`fail_under = 80` in `pyproject.toml`).
- **lint**: `ruff check .` and `ruff format --check .`.
- **complexity**: Scoped `complexipy` run on changed files against PR base.
- **ci**: Gate job requiring `test`, `lint`, and `complexity` to succeed.

---

## Database Migration Hygiene

**Relevant sources:** `src/worktree/core/db/`, `src/worktree/core/db/alembic/`

- Every new table or column must have real producer and consumer call sites in `src/` in the same PR.
- One-time data backfills must be versioned Alembic revisions (`op.execute()`), not ad-hoc raw SQL in models.
- Database repositories and facades must be constructed once per command invocation rather than inside loops.

---

## Dead Code Removal

- Verify zero call sites in `src/` prior to removing obsolete modules.
- Remove related exception types, re-exports, and tests in the same change set.
- Update documentation in the same PR to reflect removed subsystems.

---

## Versioning and Releases

**Relevant sources:** `pyproject.toml`, `.github/workflows/publish.yml`

- Dynamic package versioning via Hatchling (`hatch-vcs`) from git tags.
- Publish workflow builds and releases to PyPI when a GitHub Release is created.
